# SegmentationEngine
A segmentation engine in data science refers to a system or methodology used to segment or divide a dataset into distinct groups or segments based on certain characteristics or criteria. 

I am implementing 4 distinct types of clustering approaches:
- Centroid-Based
- Density-Based
- Distribution-Based
- Hierarchical
